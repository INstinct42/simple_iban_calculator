# Description
Just a simple python3 script to calculate a german IBAN from given BLZ and Konto-Nr.

# Usage
On the command line, call `chmod +x ./main.py` and then run the script with `./main.py BLZ KONTO`,
where `BLZ` and `KONTO` are the german _Bankleitzahl_ and _Kontonummer_.

# How to get it?
Just clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/INstinct42/simple_iban_calculator.git` or download the files manually.

__BE CAREFUL!__
Although the generated IBAN might look correct, only an IBAN generated by a bank is guaranteed to work. [Wikipedia on IBAN][1]
